# Simple-Calculator-with-Python
This is a simple calculator coded with Python. Includes four calculation methods: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

Just a personal project done during learning Python.

### How to work with it...
Everything is done by inserting values. 
You first insert the first number you will calculate, and then the second number that you will calculate the first one with. 
When you enter a letter instead of a number, it will tell you and break the operation.
When you try to divide by 0, it will tell you and break the operation.
You can exit the Calculator by typing "exit" in the number input spots instead of an actual number.
